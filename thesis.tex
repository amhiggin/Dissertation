This research has been a significant undertaking that I could not have accomplished without the support and guidance of so many different people. 

First and foremost my thanks goes to Dr. Stefan Weber, who has been an incredible support through all the trials and tribulations of this project. His insights, patience and guidance have been second-to-none.

Special mentions go to Jason Flood of IBM Ireland, Michel Oosterhof of the Cowrie project, and Tony Winters of Optum Ireland who offered valuable insights and guidance on the way forward at various points during this research.

I am incredibly fortunate to have a wonderful support network: To Tushti, Isla and {\'E}amon, thank you for listening to all of my ranting and raving and for being there to offer your advice, opinions and help with my issues (whether technical or motivational)!

Lastly and most importantly of all, to my loving family - Mom, Dad, Romy and Holly - and my incredible partner Breand{\'a}n. You have invested so much in support of my dreams and aspirations, and I could never have accomplished any of this without you.

\begin{thesisabstract}
  The Internet is becoming an increasingly hostile environment, and though the deployment of security technologies is steadily improving over time, there is a huge and increasing gap between current technological threats and the measures in place to mitigate them.
    
  This research has focused on providing enhanced security through incident-monitoring, devising a highly-deployable cyber-incident monitoring system to consolidate threat intelligence collected from a network of honeypots: An approach which promotes reactivity in the face of increased uncertainty about the nature of attacks, emphasising an active rather than passive approach to securing modern infrastructures which have seen an unprecedented growth in connectivity in critical services including health, transport and energy.

In particular, much attention in this research has focused on how such a system can feasibly provide active network defence for organisations in a way that is both practical and usable to operate and maintain. The use of containers and Platform-as-a-Service solutions in the deployment of security applications is an area where there is huge potential in this regard.

While research and industry projects have explored these uses of honeypots before including in the context of cyber-incident monitoring, this research distinguishes itself on the basis of providing a fully-networked system of honeypots packaged as a single deployable unit which can be hosted in Linux-based environments to provide active network defence in modern IT infrastructures. 

Attention has also been given to the adaptation of honeypot design to more effectively entice attacks and hence provide improved threat detection, something for which limited conclusive research exists. The exponential increase in connectivity of systems which were traditionally isolated motivates the targeting of such designs at Internet-of-Things botnets, automated attackers whose activities are a growing threat to critical service infrastructures.
