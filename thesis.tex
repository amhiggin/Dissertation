%%% This file contains a template that can be used with the package
%%% utthesis.sty and LaTeX2e to produce a thesis that meets the requirements
%%% of the Graduate School of The University of Texas at Austin.
%%%
%%% All of the commands defined by utthesis.sty have default values (see
%%% the file utthesis.sty for these values).  Thus, theoretically, you
%%% don't need to define values for any of them; you can run this file
%%% through LaTeX2e and produce an acceptable thesis, without any text.
%%% However, you probably want to set at least some of the macros (like
%%% \thesisauthor).  In that case, replace "..." with appropriate values,
%%% and uncomment the line (by removing the leading %'s).

%%% The style file was created for an American university, some information
%%% such as committee members, etc is not needed for TCD dissertations.

This research has been a significant undertaking that I could not have accomplished without the support and guidance of many individuals. 

First and foremost my thanks must go to my supervisor Dr. Stefan Weber, who has consistently been patient and supportive of me through all the issues that I have encountered. His contribution has been absolutely exceptional.

Special mentions go to Jason Flood of IBM Ireland, Michel Oosterhof of the Cowrie project, and Tony Winters of Optum Ireland who offered valuable insights and guidance on the way forward at various points in this research.

Lastly and most importantly of all, to my loving family - Mom, Dad, Romy and Holly - and my partner Breandan. I could never accomplish any of this without you.
