\section{ELK}

The Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana (ELK) stack is widely used as a means of log analysis, aggregation and visualisation. This meant that there were plentiful resources available from which to learn how to configure these tools to work together.

Some complementary tools were also used in order to facilitate the use of the ELK stack for analysis of logs from a remote machine.
