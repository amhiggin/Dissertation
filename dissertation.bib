  abstract      = {Honeypots are systems aimed at deceiving threat agents. In most of the cases the latter are cyber attackers with financial motivations, and malicious software with the ability to launch automated attacks. Honeypots are usually deployed as either production systems or as research units to study the methods employed by attackers. In this paper we present the results of two distinct research honeypots. The first acted as a malware collector, a device usually deployed in order to capture self-propagating malware and monitor their activity. The second acted as a decoy server, dropping but logging every malicious connection attempt. Both of these systems have remained online for a lengthy period of time to study the aforementioned malicious activity. During this assessment it was shown that human attackers and malicious software are constantly attacking servers, trying to break into systems or spread across networks. It was also shown that the usage of honeypots for malware monitoring and attack logging can be very effective and provide valuable data. Lastly, we present an open source visualization tool which was developed to help security professionals and researchers during the analysis and conclusion drawing phases, for use with one of the systems fielded in our study.},

  abstract  = {A lot of research has been devoted to understanding the technical properties of amplification DDoS attacks and the emergence of the DDoS-as-a-service economy, especially the so-called booters. Much less is known about the consequences for victimization patterns. We profile victims via data from amplification DDoS honeypots. We develop victimization rates and present explanatory models capturing key determinants of these rates. Our analysis demonstrates that the bulk of the attacks are directed at users in access networks, not at hosting, and even less at enterprise networks. We find that victimization in broadband ISPs is highly proportional to the number of ISP subscribers and that certain countries have significantly higher or lower victim rates which are only partially explained by institutional factors such as ICT development. We also find that victimization rate in hosting networks is proportional to the number of hosted domains and number of routed IP addresses and that content popularity has a minor impact on victimization rates. Finally, we reflect on the implications of these findings for the wider trend of commoditization in cybercrime.},

We compare active users to this set of political bots with respect to temporal tweeting behavior, the size and speed of retweet cascades, and the composition of their retweet cascades (user-to-bot vs. bot-to-bot) to evidence strategies for bot deployment. Our results move forward the analysis of political bots by showing that Twitterbots can be effective at rapidly generating small- to medium-sized cascades; that the retweeted content comprises user-generated hyperpartisan news, which is not strictly fake news, but whose shelf life is remarkably short; and, finally, that a botnet may be organized in specialized tiers or clusters dedicated to replicating either active users or content generated by other bots. }

abstract={Honeypots are valuable tools for detecting and analyzing malicious activity on the Internet. Successful and time-critical detection of such activity often depends on large-scale deployment. However, commercial organizations usually do not share honeypot data, and large, open honeypot initiatives only provide read-only alert feeds. As a result, while large and resourceful organizations can afford the high cost of this technology, smaller security firms and security researchers are fundamentally constrained. We propose and build a shared infrastructure for deploying and monitoring honeypots, called HoneyLab, that is similar in spirit to PlanetLab. With an overlay and distributed structure of address space and computing resources, HoneyLab increases coverage and accelerates innovation among security researchers as well as security industry experts relying on honeypot-based attack detection technology. Unlike current honeypot infrastructures, HoneyLab allows security firms and security researchers to deploy their own honeypot services, instrumentation code, and detection algorithms, dispensing the need for setting up a separate honeypot infrastructure whenever a new attack detection method needs to be deployed or tested.},

The purpose of the TELNET Protocol is to provide a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility. Its primary goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes to each other. It is envisioned that the protocol may also be used for terminal-terminal communication ("linking") and process-process communication (distributed computation). This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community. Hosts on the ARPA Internet are expected to adopt and implement this standard. Obsoletes NIC 18639.},
