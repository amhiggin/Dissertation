\section{Conclusions}

\section{Future Work}

There is substantial scope for additional developments based on the foundations laid by this research.

\subsection{Extension of the Cowrie Project}

During the course of the research, it was discovered that the Cowrie honeypot did not provide the capability to make outgoing network connections. By design, medium-interaction honeypots should not give an attacker the ability to use all functionality that would exist in a real environment - however, this limitation restricted the scope of the work during the project.

Given the time within which the research was being undertaken, it was not possible to extend the Cowrie source code to give it the ability to make outbound network connections over SSH and Telnet. Potential changes to the source code were documented, and are included in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Outbound SSH Connectivity}
To be completed.

\subsubsection{Outbound Telnet Connectivity}
To be completed.

\subsection{Alternative Network Configurations}

\subsection{Extension of Log Analysis}
