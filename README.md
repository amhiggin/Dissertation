# Adaptive Containerised Honeypots for Cyber-Incident Monitoring
## M.A.I. Research Dissertation 2018, Trinity College Dublin

This research has focused on providing enhanced security through incident-monitoring, devising a highly-deployable cyber-incident monitoring system to consolidate threat intelligence collected from a network of honeypots.
Such an approach promotes reactivity in the face of continually increasing uncertainty about the nature of attacks, emphasising an active rather than passive approach to securing modern infrastructures which are continuing to experience huge growth in interconnectivity.
